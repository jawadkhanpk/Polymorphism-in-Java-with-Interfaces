It is an ability of object to behave in multiple form. The most common use of polymorphism is Java, when a parent class reference type of variable is used to refer to a child
class object.
  E.g.: WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
We use method overloading and overriding to achieve Polymorphism.

There are two types of achieving Polymorphism Upcasting & Downcasting Upcasting is casting a subtype to a supertype,  going up in the inheritance tree.
It is done implicitly in order to use method available on any interface/class, the object should be of same class or of class implementing the interface.  
   
	TakeScreenShot ts = new ChromeDriver();
    
    Downcasting is casting to a subtype, going down in the inheritance tree.It is done to access sub class features. It has to be done manually

ChromeDriver driver = (ChromeDriver)Webdriver;
